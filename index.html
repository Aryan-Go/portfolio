            <h1>Hello Everybody , Aryan Goyal this side</h1>
            <h1>I live in Vasundhara Enclave , New Delhi</h1>
            <p>I’re a **front-end developer** with a passion for creating engaging, user-friendly websites. Beyond coding, I’re also excited about **music**, especially playing the **guitar** and **keyboard**, which adds a creative flair to Ir life. When I’re not coding or jamming, I love to **play sports**, embracing both physical activity and teamwork. It’s clear I have a diverse set of interests that fuel Ir creativity and drive for growth—whether it’s through building websites, making music, or staying active with sports. Keep pushing Ir boundaries in all these areas!</p>

As a full-stack web developer, I've had the opportunity to dive into both front-end and back-end development, tackling real-world challenges and learning new technologies along the way. I’m passionate about mastering every aspect of web development, from design to deployment, with the aim of building something truly impactful and useful. I’m excited to continue this journey of growth and contribute to meaningful projects in the future. </p>

                <p>I’m currently working as a software developer at Tinkering Labs, where I’m involved in a variety of exciting projects. Our team frequently engages in discussions about drones, motion sensors, and other cutting-edge technologies. One of the most fascinating aspects of our work is the integration of the metaverse, which includes augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). This adds a whole new layer of excitement and innovation to our projects. The collaborative environment allows me to explore new ideas, develop software solutions, and expand my skills in both traditional and immersive technologies. I’m excited to continue contributing to the team and learning from these hands-on experiences in such a dynamic and creative setting.</p>

                <p>Winning my first hackathon, the MIRA Hackathon, was an absolutely mesmerizing experience. The feeling of accomplishment and excitement was overwhelming as the announcement was made. I had put in so much effort, collaborating with my team, tackling challenges, and refining our project under tight deadlines. When we were declared the winners, it felt like all that hard work had truly paid off. The rush of pride and joy was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and it was a moment I’ll never forget. It fueled my passion for problem-solving and innovation, and it motivated me to keep pushing myself in the world of hackathons and tech. </p>

                <p>Creating the PAAC site with all my knowledge and effort was an incredibly rewarding experience. I poured my heart into every line of code, using everything I had learned to bring the project to life. When I found out that out of hundreds of students, only 9 were selected—and I was one of them—it was an indescribable feeling. The recognition felt like a validation of all the hard work and dedication I had put into the project. It was a moment of immense pride and accomplishment, knowing that my skills had earned me a spot among such a small, elite group. That feeling of being chosen for something I worked so hard on was truly amazing and has motivated me to keep pushing forward in my journey as a developer.</p>
