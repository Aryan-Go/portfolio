        <p>Creating the PAAC site with all my knowledge and effort was an incredibly rewarding experience. I poured my heart into every line of code, using everything I had learned to bring the project to life. When I found out that out of hundreds of students, only 9 were selected—and I was one of them—it was an indescribable feeling. The recognition felt like a validation of all the hard work and dedication I had put into the project. It was a moment of immense pride and accomplishment, knowing that my skills had earned me a spot among such a small, elite group. That feeling of being chosen for something I worked so hard on was truly amazing and has motivated me to keep pushing forward in my journey as a developer.</p>

        <p>The website that led me to my first victory in the Miraculous Hackathon was a truly challenging and rewarding experience. We focused on integrating AI and large language models (LLMs) to create a music generation tool. The project was incredibly difficult, requiring not just technical skills but also time management, as every minute counted under the tight deadlines. Despite the pressure, I learned a lot about teamwork, collaborating closely with my team to brainstorm ideas, divide tasks, and refine the project. The ideation process for the music generation aspect was both creative and technical, as we worked to make the AI generate unique and harmonious tunes. It was a deeply fulfilling experience, and winning the hackathon felt like the perfect culmination of all the hard work, creativity, and collaboration that went into the project.</p>

        <p>The first hackathon project I ever made was **JEE BUDY**, and it was a truly memorable experience. The platform was designed to help students prepare for the JEE exams by combining both theory and practicals. It featured a comprehensive collection of questions and answers for both JEE Mains and JEE Advanced, offering students a valuable resource for practice. Additionally, I incorporated various calculators to assist with time management and problem-solving, such as a speed and distance calculator, and a rank predictor. 

            Building **JEE BUDY** was an amazing challenge that allowed me to apply my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and the positive feedback from the hackathon made the experience even more rewarding. It was my first time integrating these features into a single platform, and winning the hackathon with this project gave me a strong sense of accomplishment and motivated me to keep improving my skills as a developer.</p>

        <p>Another JEE site I created during the hackathon was similar to **JEE BUDY**, featuring both theory and practicals, along with a collection of questions and answers for JEE Mains and JEE Advanced. I also included several useful calculators to aid students in their preparation, just like in my first project. 

            However, what set this site apart was the addition of **JARVIS**, an AI-powered speaking assistant for students. JARVIS was designed to assist users by answering questions, guiding them through the platform, and offering helpful tips for JEE preparation. The AI interaction made the site more engaging and user-friendly, giving students a personal assistant to help them with their studies. 
            
            Building this version of the site was another great challenge, and I’m proud of how it turned out. The incorporation of AI into the learning process not only made the site more interactive but also added an innovative touch that made it stand out during the hackathon. Winning with this project was an incredible experience that fueled my passion for combining AI and education in future projects.</p>

        <p>In this project, I had the opportunity to dive deep into **blockchain** technology alongside my teammates, and it was an incredible learning experience. The project itself was centered around providing users with an efficient way to find the best price for their trips.

            Here’s how it worked:
            1. **User Input:** The user would enter information about their planned trip, such as destination, dates, and preferences.
            2. **Auction Process:** The trip details would then be sent to a blockchain-based auction, where various service providers could bid on the trip.
            3. **Price Selection:** Once the auction was completed, the lowest price from the bids would be selected, and this price would be presented to the user, ensuring they get the best deal.
            
            Working with blockchain in this context was fascinating. We used it to create a transparent, secure, and decentralized auction process, ensuring that both users and service providers could trust the platform. This project helped me understand the practical applications of blockchain in real-world scenarios, and it was amazing to see how the technology can be used to solve complex problems like price optimization. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, and I’m excited to explore more blockchain projects in the future!</p>
